Guard 1: When do we get our super guns.
Guard 2: The big hitters get the big hitters, man.
Guard 1: We got big hitters all over these days.
Guard 2: Whaddya mean?
Guard 1: You see those two came in the other day?
Guard 2: Yeah?
Guard 2: Inspecting the base.
Guard 1: More like keeping tabs on it.
Guard 1: They act like they own the place.
Guard 1: Who are those guys?
Guard 2: Word is they got their start here. Guess you could call it a homecoming.
Guard 1: So that's how it is.
Guard 1: Crap. We'd better move.
Guard 2: Yeah.
