Guard 1: They said to stay away from part of admin for now, right?
Guard 2: The boiler room.
Guard 1: Right
Guard 1: I hear they were doing some kind of questioning in there.
Guard 2: Questioning?
Guard 1: That "enemy combatant" in the prison area got taken down there every day.
Guard 2: What are they trying to do anyway?
Guard 1: That's above my paygrade.
Guard 2: Aren't you a little curious?
Guard 1: Look. All I know is they've been doing some secret project and this "enemy combatant" has information they need.
Guard 2: I wonder if it has to do with the tremors...
Guard 1: WHAT?
Guard 2: Forget I said anything.
