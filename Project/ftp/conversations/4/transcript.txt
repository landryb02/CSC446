Guard 2: What's going on?
Guard 1: You did an inventory of the armory day before yesterday, right?
Guard 2: Yeah. Haven't been in there for 6 months.
Guard 1: If you're not the gunny, you ain't seeing much of that place.
Guard 2: Couldn't believe it's still just an ordinary little password lock on it.
Guard 1: Right, you would think they'd be more careful with firepower like that.
Guard 2: It's right in the middle of the base though. Nobody's getting in there.
Guard 1: Still. You never know, man.
Guard 2: No way - end of story.
