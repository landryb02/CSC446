                                Metal Gear REX has launched 8 ICBMs to all the network satellites.
                                It also has self-destructed and left a nuclear wasteland
                                in western Alaska.
                                Your success has been recorded in the system logs.
                                The entire system will crash as soon as the missiles hit.
                                Do not be alarmed when everything crashes :).
