Intro to Networks

What is a network?
-Fundamentally it's just a bunch of connected entities
-These are typically entitled nodes
-We call these connections "links"

Computers on a network are connected through an ip address that is specific to eachother
What do messages really look like on the internet?
-Messages are split up into packages
-Each packed is composed of:
	a source ip address (the sender)
	a target ip address (the receiver)
	a sequence number (to preserve the order of the message)
	a part of the message
-The packet could be sent in any order!
-Network packets are NUMBERED to keep order so that when the receiver gets the message, it can be correctly reconstructed
